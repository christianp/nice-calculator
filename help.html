        This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">RPN</a>, or stack-based, calculator.
        You put numbers on the stack, and then you do things to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, to work out <em>1 + 3</em>, you'd:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style: disc;">
          <li>Type <code>1</code></li>
          <li>Press <code>Enter</code></li>
          <li>Type <code>3</code></li>
          <li>Press <code>Enter</code></li>
          <li>Press <code>+</code></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It's a different way of doing things to a normal calculator, but it can be much more efficient for complicated calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This calculator not only displays the results of calculations, but shows you what went into producing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The display shows the current stack. Input numbers are shown in blue, and operations are shown in yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type a number and press <code>Enter</code> to push it onto the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can tap any item on the stack to select it, or use the arrow keys to move the selection. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you push a number, it's inserted below the selected item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Input numbers inside an operation can't be deleted, but they can be changed, moved or copied.
      </p>
      <p>
        To change a number inside an operation, select it, type the new value, and press <code>Enter</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you copy a number, it's given a label to identify it. If you change the value of the number, it changes in all the copies too.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Nested operations are folded up by default. Click on an operation to unfold it and see what's inside.
